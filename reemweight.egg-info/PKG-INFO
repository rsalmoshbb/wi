Summary: <The Python package is designed to assist with the initialization of weights in a neural network sequential model. The package uses machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to initialize the weights, which can lead to improved model performance. Additionally, the package provides a means to compare the results of this weight strategy with other weight initialization strategies.>
