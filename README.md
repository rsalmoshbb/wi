reemweight Package
reemweight is a Python package that provides a simple and efficient way to initialize the weights of a neural network sequential model using machine learning algorithms (MLAs).The package compares the performance of these MLAs with other weight initialization strategies such as Xavier and provides the user with the best weight initialization strategy for their neural network.
